# Predicting-Barbell-Exercises
This is an end-to-end machine learning project that uses Feedforward Neural Network, Random Forest and Simple Decision Tree to predict barbell exercises. It uses accelerometer and gyroscope data collected by a fitness device to predict which exercise was performed and how many repetitions.
